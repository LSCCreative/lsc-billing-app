# Handover: Finance & Price (Price Calculator)

Read this first, then [`DESIGN_BRIEF.md`](DESIGN_BRIEF.md). This track **restructures the live
Finance area** built in [`.design/overhead-finance/`](../overhead-finance/) — that folder stays the
authority for every decision this one does not explicitly overturn.

**Build bucket: `Opus, effort: high`.** Money math plus a nav restructure on a live site. The route
work is not in the Sonnet bucket here, because it moves the divisor behind every rate on the card.

## What this is

A left-sidebar Finance & Price area with a read-only Dashboard that shows the whole cost-to-rate
chain on one screen: overhead (including gear depreciation), real working-days capacity, profit
goals, and the hourly / half-day / full-day floors they imply — compared against what the rate card
actually charges. Modelled on the user's `Price Calculator` reference spreadsheet, reshaped for a
service business that sells shoot days rather than units.

## State as of 2026-10-03

**Build complete and live** (NAS migrated to v7 then later versions; Pages current): all 23 tasks, the
design review's must-fix and nine of ten should-fixes, and the 2026-09-28 money-math audit (15
findings, decisions 6–9 below). **Only open item: a real VoiceOver pass by a person.**

The per-task build log that used to sit here ("What landed", ~1,500 lines of what each task changed,
verified and decided) was removed to save agent tokens. The code, `calc.js`'s decision-recording
header and the tests are the record; `git log -p -- .design/price-calculator/HANDOVER.md` has the old
text if ever needed. Everything durable from it is in the sections below and in
[`INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`](INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) (read/write map, arithmetic order,
depreciation chain).

## Resolved decisions (Lachlan, 2026-09-27 — do not re-litigate)

All eleven are written up in the brief's "Resolved Decisions" section with the reasoning. The five
that will get questioned by a fresh agent:

1. **Finance is renamed `Finance & Price` and restructured, not supplemented.** A second area
   writing the same singleton `goals` row would break "one number, one truth".
2. **The 48-week year is retired.** Capacity becomes four real fields; annual billable hours are
   derived. On the reference defaults this is 1,776 hrs vs today's 1,920 — **every overhead-derived
   rate rises ~8%, knowingly.**
3. **Day and half-day are separate rate-card rows with independent prices.** A half day is not half
   a full day. No 0.5 multiplier.
4. **Depreciation produces two numbers from one table**: the ATO figure for the accountant's CSV, and
   a straight-line replacement reserve over the user's own cycle for the overhead rate. Tax
   depreciation would swing the day rate 30–40% year to year for gear still in use.
5. **One capacity pool.** No shoot-day cap. The post-to-shoot ratio is too variable to enforce; it
   appears as an editable Dashboard readout instead.

Also settled: GST is an editable mirror of `settings.gst` (currently `registered: false`), not a
copy; the floor compares against `mu`, not `rate`; nothing ever auto-writes the rate card.

**Reopened and re-decided by the user on 2026-09-28, after the money-math audit** (these replace
earlier entries — don't revert them to the old ones):

6. **The rate card is measured against an INCOME floor**: Target Annual Revenue ÷ annual billable
   hours, so it carries the owner's pay. The cost floor (overhead × (1 + markup)) is still shown
   beside it and still drives the estimate editor's Minimum Job Price. This overturns the
   2026-09-15 "no wage term" decision *for the floors only*; `mu` is still never written.
7. **"Target Profit Margin" is renamed Target Markup** — labels only. It was always applied as a
   markup; no figure changed. The DB column keeps its old name.
8. **Income tax uses the ATO resident brackets + Medicare levy**, stored per FY in `tax_years`,
   entered and confirmed by the user (placeholders prefilled, flagged). Tax is levied on the pay,
   not on revenue: running costs are added untaxed. The old flat-rate-on-revenue model is gone.
9. **Saved estimate lines keep their own price** (a snapshot on the line), with an explicit
   "Update to current rates" button, and a "Use rates from last project" toggle for a client
   who has been quoted before — the user's own addition to the recommended option.

## Accounting rules a fresh agent will get wrong

All of these are settled in the IA doc's "Arithmetic Order" section. Listed here because each one
produces a plausible-looking wrong number rather than an error.

- **The deduction is apportioned by business-use %; the adjustable value is not.** It declines by the
  full decline in value. Apportioning both overstates the closing value of every part-personal asset
  for the rest of its life.
- **`daysHeld` runs from `start_date` (ATO "start time" — first used or installed ready for use), not
  `purchase_date`.** Two separate date fields, both required.
- **Australian FY is 1 July – 30 June.** One shared FY helper; never `new Date().getFullYear()`
  inline, which is off by up to twelve months for half the year.
- **Leave and sick days are entered in WORKING days, not calendar days.** Four weeks' leave is 20, not
  28. The labels must say so.
- **`÷ 365` even in leap years**, and the diminishing-value factor is `200%` for assets held from
  10 May 2006. Both are published formula, not arithmetic to correct.
- **`replacement_cost_estimate`, not historical cost**, drives the replacement reserve — pricing has
  to recover what the next body costs.
- **Double-counting is possible and nothing structurally prevents it**: a camera entered as a one-off
  operating expense *and* as an asset inflates every rate. Mitigated by always showing the annual
  cost split Operating / Replacement reserve, plus a soft prompt on large one-off entries.

## Open seams

- **`goals.billable_capacity_hrs_per_week` is KEPT**, recomputed on save as `annualBillableHours ÷ 52`,
  and read by nothing. Resolved in Phase 3: dropping it means a SQLite table rebuild and a migration
  that would have to invent leave and sick values it cannot infer. Its schema comment must mark it
  legacy and display-only, or the next agent will either delete it mid-feature or compute from it.
- ~~**`overheadRatePerHour()`'s second parameter changes meaning**~~ — **DONE 2026-09-27.** See
  "What landed — the capacity model". The one live seam it leaves behind is the transitional legacy
  branch in `annualBillableHoursFromGoals()`, which the Capacity screen task deletes.
- **`annualOverheadTotal()` keeps its name and behaviour** so existing tests pass; screens move to a
  new `annualBusinessCost(items, assets)`.
- **`finance.js`'s router contract gains one argument**: `selectTab(id, opts)` forwarding an inner-tab
  id, so the Dashboard can deep-link to Overhead → Depreciation.
- **The capacity migration cannot infer leave and sick days** from the single weekly figure that
  existed before, so it seeds the reference defaults (8 / 5 / 30 / 8) and the Capacity screen flags
  them as defaults to confirm.
- **ATO thresholds and effective lives stay user-entered**, with the current figure as a placeholder
  and a confirm-with-your-accountant note. Both move with the federal budget. Nobody should
  "helpfully" hardcode them later.
- **Depreciation schedules are computed on read, not stored** — single source of truth — with an
  append-only `depreciation_locks` row freezing a FY once the user marks it lodged.
- **Info controls are buttons, not hover tooltips.** The user asked for hover; hover-only fails
  keyboard and touch, and both explanations carry money meaning. Button + `aria-expanded` popover,
  with hover as an enhancement. Agreed in the brief's Accessibility section — do not simplify it
  back to a `title` attribute.

## How to verify your work

- `npm test` inside `server/` after any change under `server/` — the acceptance gate for this phase.
- `calc.js` changes must be applied identically to `server/src/calc.js` and `web/js/calc.js` — the
  last test in `test-calc.js` fails if they drift. The `hoursPerUnit` default-of-1 coverage now
  exists (see "What landed"); keep it passing rather than rewriting it.
- For anything in the money-math bucket, **check the mutation, not just the green suite**: break the
  line you just wrote, confirm a test fails, put it back. The capacity task next up moves every rate
  on the card, and a test that passes both ways is worse than no test.
- The live site is GitHub Pages + the NAS API over Cloudflare Tunnel. Logins are in
  `.credentials.local.md` at the repo root (gitignored). Ask the user to sign in before browser
  testing — real mouse clicks in the browser pane do not always reach the page; verify with a
  dispatched `.click()` and poll on a DOM condition.
- Above 1100px, every *ported* screen must still look as it did; only the container narrows by the
  sidebar rail's width.
